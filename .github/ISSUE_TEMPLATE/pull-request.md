about: Add new Code Examples to Catalog
title: "[NEW EXAMPLE] <<Language>> <<Service>> <<Description of Examples>>"
labels: ''
assignees: ''

---

Each example should contain the following metadata. Some of the fields like keyword and service can be used multiple times as needed. For snippet-service, use the AWS Service Namespace as listed in our [General Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces).  If the example uses multiple services, be sure to include each service on a separate line. 

Use comment denotations appropriate for each langague.
